  <h2>Why Become a Mentor?</h2>
    <p>At our hackathon there will be many hackers looking to learn more about coding, and they will need your expertise to help them learn and achieve great things. For people who are more experienced or not able to compete since you are not in high school, this is a great way for you to volunteer your time to help and inspire these new students.</p>
    <p>We will provide food and a special T-Shirt for mentors who volunteer for our event. We will also have lots of fun activities you can partake in also!</p>
  <h2>What exactly will I be doing?</h2>
    <p>There are a lot of things you can help out with as a mentor, here is a list of some suggestions we have for you.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Help students out with their projects - syntax, process, etc.</li>
      <li>Give groups some inspiration for their project, help them come up with a great ideo or encourage them to challenge themselves.</li>
      <li>Just talk with people - This is a social event, socializing is a great way to get to know other people, learn more, and just have a great time.</li>
      <li>Assist with workshops - we will be having many workshops where students will learn more about different languages or technology</li>
      <li>And anything else you think will make the event more enjoyable for anyone.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>We want this to be a social event, so do not be afraid to go up to someone, introduce yourself, and just have a good conversation while maybe teaching the students a thing or two. Our event would not be possible without mentors, which is why we would love for you to volunteer on our journey to help spread our passion for coding.</p>
